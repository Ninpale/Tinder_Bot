to run the :cupid:Tinder Bot:

download chromedriver, unzip, move to /usr/local/bin (mac os / linux)
<br />pip install selenium
<br />create a secrets.py file with variables:

    username = 'your_username'
    password = 'your_password'
 
Add model-resnet.h5 in beauty_predict folder. You can find it [here](http://plong.perso.centrale-marseille.fr/visible/model-resnet.h5).

Add more features to this, would be awesome to see what you can come up with!

Please note that a few updates, and code adjustments will be necessary for you to run it. 
<br />Also, Tinder is updating its website interface very often and it will require you to update your code so the bot clicks on the right buttons.
